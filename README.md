Graylog configurations
======================

This project contains information to help getting started creating a Graylog server instance. Included are server configurations files for Graylog collector, Logstash pipelines, and custom Extractors for dealing with Java Stack traces and logback default output format.

Graylog Master Server Setup
---------------------------

#### Installation and Setup

#### Adding Input and Extractors

##### Extractors
------------------------------------
Extractors are used to format or perform conversion on incoming messages received by Graylog inputs.  The goal of extraction should be to extract and normalize enough data from the raw data contained in each message to  enable querying the data, providing useable results.  Each input containing a different or new message format will require a new set of extractors, tailored to parse the data appropriately. 


Providing Input to the Master GL Server
---------------------------------------

#### Tailing Existing Log Files from Remote Applications

##### Graylog Collector
To continuously watch a remote application's current logfile for new entries (think tail) use a Graylog Collector.  Collectors use TCP to send log messages to the GL master server.

-- Install Graylog Collector 
> download the collector
wget https://packages.graylog2.org/releases/graylog-collector/graylog-collector-0.4.2.tgz

> move the tar to /<graylog_intallation_path>/graylog-collector and unpack using:
tar -zxvf graylog-collector-0.4.2.tgz

-- Setting up the config
> copy the sample collector config to the config directory (I used PuTTy):
pscp graylog_collector.conf root@<remote_logging_machine_ip>:/<graylog_home>/graylog-collector/config

-- Starting graylog collector from command line
> modify the config to point to the GL master server and use any new ports if
  any new inputs were created on the GL master.
> from the graylog home directory (installation directory) run:
bin/graylog-collector run -f graylog_collector.conf


##### Logstash Pipeline 
To pipe old (not-current) log files into Graylog, use a logstash pipeline to process files individually and push entries to the master GL server. 

-- Install Logstash 
> download logstash
wget https://download.elastic.co/logstash/logstash/logstash-2.1.1.tar.gz

> move the tar to /<logstash_intallation_path>/logstash-2.1.1 and unpack using:
tar -zxvf logstash-2.1.1.tar.gz

-- Setting up the config
> copy the sample logstash config to the installation directory (I used PuTTy):
pscp logstash_pipeline.conf root@<remote_logging_machine_ip>:/<logstash_home>/logstash-2.1.1

-- Starting logstash pipeline from command line
> modify the config to point to the GL master server and use any new ports if
  any new inputs were created on the GL master.
> modify the config for each logfile to pipe
> from the logstash home directory (installation directory) run:
bin/logstash -f logstash_pipeline.conf


#### Using an Appender to Send Remote Application Log Entries Directly

##### To change an application to directly sent log entries to GL, use an appender.
